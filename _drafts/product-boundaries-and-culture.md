title: LESSONS IN BUILDING PRODUCTS FOR CULTURAL CHANGE
---


- Building products is a physical agreement of cultural interaction and responsibilities.  We didn't learn that early enough -- to get clarity on boundaries between what the product should push at vs. what a specific person in the company has to take on

Example: architecture/engineer training groups using event streaming.

By not having this agreement, it can easily mis-align the product focus.  But possibly worse, is it prevents the other part of the organization from growing together with what the product is changing.  It represents a mis-alignment of cultural direction, and this debt will get called due. I find the terms of repayment are steep.

While building the product, must have internal agreements of "soft" responsibilities.  The product boundaries end where you have agreement with other involved groups around cultural interaction and responsibilities.

Part of the value of a roadmap is agreeing with other groups how they have to shift their behavior and making sure they are aware and ready for different tools.  In this way, roadmap doesn't just communicate what value you aim to deliver when, but also as a way for partner groups in the company to align and make necessary changes.  This is an absolute dependency.  In my previous job we pushed past the slowness of change in partner groups and it slowly added more and more debt, complexity, cost, and slowness to our abilities to affect change.

The culture is a refelction of its people.  A product cannot push cultural change, it can only support it.  People and changes in behavior push cultural change.

This extends to the most senior management first:

Where does the product stop and personal/user responsibility/expertise begin?  There is this idea that if you build the "perfect" product, then you can do well with less training, or paying for less experienced engineers.  This is wrong primarily because there is no "perfect" product that I've seen.
