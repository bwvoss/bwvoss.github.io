title: THEY LIE
---

"The trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel, they don't say what they think and they don't do what they say." - David Ogilvy
"Have you asked customers what they want?"

No, they often don't know.  They do know what frustrates them.

1. Observe what they do, not just what they say
2. Grok what they feel through empathy and psychology
3. Leverage behavioral data
