title: PMs ARE TRANSLATORS
---

In my team's latest sprint planning, the engineers were pitching specific technical debt items for higher prioritization.  They were phrased generally, like "tech debt in our pipeline configurations have to be fixed" and "there are some permission gaps".  It is common (expected, really) that different stakeholders will phrase important asks in their own context, view, and language.

It is the job of the PM to _translate_ the requirement to the value the personna cares so actual prioritization can occur.  For example, when diving deeper into the "tech debt in our pipelines" problem, fixing the problem would realize a higher throughput for the team, but also a lower change fail percentage.  Now, that is something a PM can sell to stakeholders and users, or at least we are now one step closer to having the requirement quantified for prioritization.

The next step is to determine: is improving our throughput or change fail percentage the focus?  And what is the cost?  Ideally, a PM would be able to translate this again into economic variables; or tie them to impact in the prioritization criteria.  The primiary theme of the time was operational availability, so change fail percentage was a key metric and was the metric we used to phrase the value before tieing it to imapct.
