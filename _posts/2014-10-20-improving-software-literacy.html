Think about punctuation as being the user interface to written language.  The design solves problems in interpretation, recitation or understanding.  It is beyond the control of an individual, and new technological devices present original ways to change.
</p>

<p>
<em>Scriptio continua</em> -- <em>continuous script</em> -- dominated writing in the West up until about 1000 A.D.  If the interface had never evolved from there,

Printing and copying technologies during the medieval times lowered the cost of written communication.  Instead of one copy of the Bible, or one copy of the teachings of Cicero hand-written by highly-trained, and expensive scribes, copies were made at a faster rate, and for a fraction of the price.

<p>
Low literacy rates influenced printings to be made with the expectation to be read aloud.  Copyists popularized capital letters and commas to aid in recitation.  Different copies of the Bible toyed with indented layouts and gave a new line to every <em>sense-unit</em> -- something like a whitespace sensitive version of written language.

Similar changes have taken place recently in China.  Less than 100 years ago, <em>traditional script</em> dominated written Chinese. Today, <em>simplified script</em> dominates.  Mao Zedong popularized and centralized the use of Simplified Chinese to battle illiteracy in rural China:

Natural languages, and the changes undergone, tell how to better look at readability in software.  Simplified Chinese shows complexity decreases literacy.  Extract more functions or classes to reduce the lines of code a reader needs to parse. Introduce polymorphism to replace dense conditional chains.  The <em>sense-units</em> of certain versions of the Bible show the power of indentation and white-space.  Speed to literacy is one of the greatest metrics a system can boast.

<p>
Software -- like Bibles, political treatises, and love letters -- are written <em>for other people</em>.  Instead of asking: “Do I understand this?” when writing code, ask: “Would the most elementary developer working here understand this?”.
