title: HOW TECHNICAL IS A TPM?
---

Question:

>As a TPM, how technical should I be?

## Replace the "T"

I get asked this question a lot by newer TPMs, often coming from an engineering role. TPMs are really just PMs with strong technical backgrounds that build products for technical folks.  But, at the end of the day we are _PMs_.  This allows us to pivot the question:

>As a PM, how well do I have to know my product's domain?

At this point, it just kinda seems obvious, doesn't it?  You have to know it _really really_ well. TPMs often are engineers first, so it's difficult for us to think of ourselves now as product managers first, especially when we were just building software in the domain we now manage products within. However, the complexity in this problem is rooted in that as an engineer, technical == writing code.  But, as a PM being technical == understanding the technical domain well enough to make better economic trade-offs for the benefit of the product.  Specifically, what are type of technical competencies?

The best TPMs are deeply technical, often seen as SMEs -- subject matter experts -- within their technical domain.  They were often experienced engineers first.  Here are common behaviors:

- Staying aware of the "cutting edge"/developing technologies and approaches.  _Am I aware of how technology is changinging in my domain?  How would that benefit the users?  Am I overdelegating the understanding of capabilities offered by the technology to my engineering team?_
- Knowing the design/architecture well enough to determine general technical cost-benefit analysis of product changes. _If my technical lead were out, would I be able to have rational design discussions with our engineers?_
- Dogfooding their product for their own work/breakable toys. _Am I staying as technical as the users?  Or is their world changing in a way that makes understanding mechanical sympathy more problemattic? Am I able to empathize sufficiently?_
- Extra Credit: Enganging the broader community via speaking or writing.
