title: HOW TECHNICAL IS A TPM?
---

Question:

>As a TPM, how technical should I be?

## Replace the "T"

I get asked this question a lot, and as a question, it's too broad. TPMs are really just PMs with strong technical backgrounds that build products for technical folks.  But, at the end of the day we are _PMs_.  This allows us to pivot the question to:

>As a PM, how well do I have to know my product's domain?

At this point, it just kinda seems obvious, doesn't it?  You have to know it _really really_ well. Side note: TPMs often are engineers first, so it's difficult for us to think of ourselves as now as product managers first, especially when we were just building software in the domain we now manage products within. However, the complexity in this problem is rooted in that as an engineer, technical == writing code.  But, as a PM being technical == the ability to make better economic trade-offs for the benefit of the users and investors ("investor" may simply be your department allocating you some budget).

The best TPMs are deeply technical, often seen as SMEs -- subject matter experts -- within their technical domain.  They were often experienced engineers first.  Here are common behaviors I'd expect:

- Staying aware of the "cutting edge"/developing technologies and approaches.  _Am I aware of how technology is changinging in my domain?  How would that benefit the users?  Am I overdelegating technical capabilities to my engineering team?_
- Knowing the design/architecture well enough to determine general technical cost-benefit analysis of product changes. _If my technical lead were out, would I be able to have rational design discussions with our engineers?_
- Dogfooding their product for their own work/breakable toys. _Am I staying as technical as the users?  Or is their world changing in a way that makes understanding mechanical sympathy more problemattic? Am I able to empathize sufficiently?_
- Extra Credit: Enganging the broader community via speaking or writing.
