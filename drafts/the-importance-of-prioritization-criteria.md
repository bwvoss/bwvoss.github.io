title: THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA
---

>TLDR/Main Points:
> We can acheive better understanding of how to priortize by learning about sorting algorithms

Google/Oxford Languages defines prioritization as: _"the action or process of deciding the relative importance or urgency of a thing or things"_.

Prioritization is, at its most fundamental, a simple sorting algorithm.  A sorting algorithm needs: a list of items to sort, and a way to compare one item with another (comparator).  If the items in a list are not like one another, then the algorithm will not know how to properly order them.  "Canonicalization" is the term used to convert data that has multiple representations into a standard or "canonical" form. ie: [1, "two", "III"] -> [1, 2, 3]

In computer science, sorting algorithm efficiency, often described in Big Oh notation, is the main measure of value of the algorithm.  So its not only about putting a list in a correct order but optimizing the efficiency.  Sorting algorithms are fundamental in other more complicated algorithms and programs so fine-tuned efficiency is necessary not to compound slowness to more it is built upon.








What makes prioritization difficult?

The _relative_ part is what makes prioritization more complicated.  Relative implies comparison and the problems a PM has to prioritize solving may impact different groups in different ways making relative comparison very difficult.  If we have a bucket of stones and have to put them in order based on weight, that is a simple sorting algorithm.

Being aware of all options to prioritize is difficult as well.


There seems to be a large variety of thought around the role of a PM when it comes to determining the priorities of a team or product.  I've seen:

1. The hero: PM goes into a room and doesn't emerge for weeks on end.  Finally returns with perfectly prioritized vision.
2. The servant: PM reactively takes orders from all interested parties.  A victim of circumstances with prioritization directly related to the volume used when requested by a stakeholder or user.
3. The guide: PM collaborates closely with colleagues, teammates, and stakeholders to drive consensus.



As a PM, it is my job to be as close to choice 3 as possible.

There is a clear lifecycle to a period of prioritization: expansion, then reduction

Collaboration

Then

Reduction

Go through each and show how they fall short on impact or focus.



PMs are decision makers, but must discuss with the team.  Establishing the criteria sets the team up for a guided conversation where we determine what has to be moved to the front, or when something has to be removed from the roadmap.

Prioritization is a process the PM owns, but collaborates with colleagues and teammates around.

In the context of prioritization, the role of a PM is one that guides their colleagues and teammates in conversations to discover the priorities.

Prioritization, and many disagreements within, are because much is subjective and context dependent.

PMs do not disappear for weeks on end and come back with a fully-baked list of priorities.  PMs own guiding their team and colleagues towards a list of priorities.  Having clear criteria facilitates the discussions.

## How long until the prioritization period ends/renews?

Depends on the context of planning in your company.  Quarterly is very common.

Contextually during execution, there will be a different ruleset.

## What are some common Prioritization Criteria frameworks?

1. Determine the themes

The first thing I like to do, and I'm speaking from being a PM within a larger company, is to understand the larger themes or goals the company is trying to acheive so that my product can fit within and contribute in an aligned way.


1. Importance to Satisfaction

2. Impact, Urgency, Cost

## The Importance of Retrospectives

As with anything that lacks exact precision in decision making, I will occasionally make calls where, looking back, I would've prioritized differently.  We will never have all of the information available to us when making decisions, but its important to keep learning when the imperfect call happens.

For example: not prioritizing table stakes soon enough, or not prioritizing how change will be made at scale before making a piece of technology more open for adoption.
