Series on the differences in building products for internal company usage.

OR: the company should provide the product vision.  The purpose of a product vision is to generate initial funding

> As a TPM building products for engineers internally, how different of a PM experience is it compared to selling products to external customers?

- There really isn't any external, open market competition.  You are operating in a closed market.  In many ways a monopoly.

- The "delight" factor isn't as important.  Blemishes are easier to accept because having fanatical customers, or being "sticky" isn't as important.  Where are your users going to go?

- Finding your users is different.  You don't really find the "ideal" customer to be the core user/evangelist.  It is more common to be told who the people you have to serve is, and often they are not the ideal customers you'd choose.

I receive this question quite a bit, and ask myself when I read PM literature and ideas.  TPMs building internal toolsets are in a slightly different world than a "normal" PM.  There are many of the same responsibilities, for example both TPMs and PMs are responsible for:

- product vision
- product strategy with a clear set of key and backstop metrics
- product roadmap, or a transparent prioritization process around user/customer segments
- iterative releases, ideally with incremental rollouts testing against the metrics to both confirm new benefits while also not compromising backstop metrics; root cause anaysis/funnels
- evangelizing or teaching; talking with the end users

But, I wanted to highlight some specific use cases where building internal products are more difficult to align to some necessary PM fundamentals.

## Customer Segment/Opportunity Selection

When you are developing a product to sell, you will be the one setting the product vision.  When a product is determined interally, its common that the product vision will more-or-less be crafted for you and handed to you to execute.  For example, when I was in charge of delivery infrastructure, I didn't invent these concepts, someone much higher up determined it was the right place to invest, earmarked the money, and put the pieces in place.  It was now on me as TPM to prove the funding was correctly placed, but the product vision or mission was already well established by the time I became involved as TPM.

Out of these groups, which one should I address?

## Establishing an Economic Framework

When a product is considered, or prototyped and tested, the key metrics that validate whether its the right economic decision are fairly clear.  Either its increasing ad clicks, or cart-to-orders, or something that is one step away from revenue.  When building tools for engineers, we are an extra step removed which makes apples-to-apples comparisons more difficult.

## Acquiring the Customer; Battling against free market choices/competition

marketing and "customer" acquisition is different.

Buyer vs. customer.   ie: salesforce is purchased by the VP of Sales, with General Counsel, etc.  Not the core user.  Building products internally is similar.  You have "buyers", or the VPs that allocate budget and direction, and the "users" or the engineers/builders.  What the buyers need to see may not be the same as the users.

Most PM literature is written with a focus on selling a product externally to your company
Overall: we are two steps removed from normal product management philosophy.  Pros and Cons of such.

Structure: go down common behaviors as a PM and how that changes vs. not

- Option: if you do a great job, its sellable by the company. Example: AWS
- customers, addressable market, funding, all this is different inside of a company
- having those customer take it or leave it also is not really the goal
