> As a TPM, I read lots of PM materials, but some of the concepts don't quite align.  For example, 


It can be difficult transitioning PM ideas into building internal toolsets as products for engineers. For both TPMs and PMs, we are responsible for:

- product vision
- product strategy with a clear set of key and backstop metrics
- product roadmap, or a transparent prioritization process around user/customer segments
- iterative releases, ideally with incremental rollouts testing against the metrics to both confirm new benefits while also not compromising backstop metrics; root cause anaysis/funnels
- evangelizing or teaching; talking with the end users
- showing results

So at a high level, the jobs generally have the same requirements. But, when training to become a better TPM, most of the literature is written for PMs instead.  I wanted to use this post to dive into some of the differences I've experienced, and how to drive towards position parity.

Let's talk a bit about product vision.  When you are developing a product to sell, you will be the one setting the product vision.  When a product is determined interally, its common that the product vision will more-or-less be crafted for you and handed to you to execute.  For example, when I was in charge of delivery infrastructure, I didn't invent these concepts, someone much higher up determined it was the right place to invest, earmarked the money, and put the pieces in place.  It was now on me as TPM to prove the funding was correctly placed, but the product vision or mission was already well established by the time I became involved as TPM.

This is not a bad thing!  TPMs already have enough coordination overhead to handle.


- first, from a clear economic framework.  When a product is considered, or prototyped and tested, the key metrics that validate whether its the right economic decision are fairly clear.  Either its increasing ad clicks, or cart-to-orders, or something that is one step away from revenue.  When building tools for engineers, we are an extra step removed which makes apples-to-apples comparisons more difficult.

- second, marketing and "customer" acquisition is different.

Buyer vs. customer.   ie: salesforce is purchased by the VP of Sales, with General Counsel, etc.  Not the core user.  Building products internally is similar.  You have "buyers", or the VPs that allocate budget and direction, and the "users" or the engineers/builders.  What the buyers need to see may not be the same as the users.

Most PM literature is written with a focus on selling a product externally to your company
Overall: we are two steps removed from normal product management philosophy.  Pros and Cons of such.

Structure: go down common behaviors as a PM and how that changes vs. not

- Option: if you do a great job, its sellable by the company. Example: AWS
- customers, addressable market, funding, all this is different inside of a company
- having those customer take it or leave it also is not really the goal
