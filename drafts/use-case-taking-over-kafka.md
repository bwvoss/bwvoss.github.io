title: USE CASE: BEING THE TPM of KAFKA SERVICES
---

I was asked to take on ownership of the "kafka" product team.  I want to walk you through how I went from no technical understanding to successful product impact.

What steps did I take?  And why?

1. Learned Kafka

- got into a loop-driven development process.  Actually started coding with the team.
- Dogfooded
- clearly understood the architecture and why it is designed the way it is.
- read "Kafka: The Definitive Guide"

#### Benefits
The team didn't really provide "kafka" -- that's a brand-name.  The team provided benefits.  So...why kafka?  For event streaming benefits?  Why even streaming?

2. Setting Vision and Strategy

3. Users and Pain Points

4. Prioritization

5. Established Interaction Experience and Evangelize

Create page that talks about the different use cases event driven is used for.  Then, show exmaples and document the interface for usage.
