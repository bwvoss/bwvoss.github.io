title: USE CASE: TPM of KAFKA SERVICES
---

I was asked to take on ownership of the "kafka" product team.  I want to walk you through how I went from no technical understanding to successful product impact.

What steps did I take?  And why?

1. Learning Kafka

1.a. Reframing

The team didn't really provide "kafka" -- that's a brand-name.  The team provided benefits.  So...why kafka?  For event streaming benefits?  Why even streaming?

2. Setting Vision and Strategy

3. Users and Pain Points

4. Prioritization
