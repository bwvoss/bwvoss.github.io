As a TPM, you should always be building products as breakable toys.  This is an important concept when I was learning to be a better software engineer, and the model holds as a product manager as well.  Even if its for a resume, showing products you have established and how gives the employer a fantastic litmus for your abilities.

### Ok so I have made the decision to start a product as a breakable toy.  This helps for a few reasons:

- One of the core models in breakable toys is _passion_.  Instead of technical product management being a career, its also something that I should love to do.  When I was programming full time and felt deflated, breakable toys would often bring enthusiasm back into the craft.

- It takes some pressure off.  This thing has no expectation of succeeding, right?  This lowers the resistance to taking action and helps me take risks exploring interesting, yet unlikely to succeed product ideas.

## So how do I generate ideas for breakable toys?

- As described above, choosing a technology, or idea that you are passionate about is a must-have.  I couldn't imagine building a breakable toy I don't have passion for.

- It should be something you personally would find interesting or useful to use.  In typical product managment, we start "outside-in" by understanding the needs or benefits a specific group of people need solved and in that group of needs there are some important yet undersatisfied opportunities.  I take the same approach, but I just do some personal exploration vs. market research and talking with lots of people.

## Let's start one now!

Recently, I've been diving deep into Kafka.  It is a technology I want to get better at.  I know it at a high level, I can articulate why its useful, but a breakable toy using Kafka (or hosted versions of it like AWS MSK Kafka is a fantastic product
