title: PRODUCT EVALUATION USING THE KANO-ISH MODEL
---

How we prioritize and how we evaluate the product's value proposition are similiar.

We list a table and break down the must-haves, performance benefits, and delighters.  From Adam Nash's prioritization [https://adamnash.blog/2009/07/22/guide-to-product-planning-three-feature-buckets/] model it is very similar: metric movers, customer requests, and delighters.  They are essentially the same and choose based on how closely the model makes sense to how you already think towards product analysis and prioritization.

But that begs the question: is a product's unique value and how the PM prioritizes needs to solve for the product the same approach?

Ultimately, the strategy I take to provide value is the first type of prioritization I do as a PM.  Then, the problem space shifts as you learn more and user needs shift, so recurring prioritization continues.  Each segment of prioritization is another unique value proposition to your users.  Strategy and prioritization is a recurring circle.  Strategy _is_ prioritization and how we track success in solving the problems we prioritized solving.


So: Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab are the 3 alternatives.  Do a breakdown for each.
