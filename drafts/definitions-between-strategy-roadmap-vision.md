title: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE: A discussion of nomenclature
---

For every product manager, there are 3 artifacts that are in nearly every job description: product vision, strategy, and roadmap.  They build upon one another, where if the vision isn't right, the strategy likely won't be totally right, and then the roadmap will be even further from "right".

## Vision

The main job: to explain to your team and stakeholders _why_ this product deserves to exist.

From a team standpoint, it helps focus decision making, and from a stakeholder standpoint, it helps justify investment.

A vision answers:

1. What is the driving purpose?
2. Why would the users prefer that over the status quo?

## Strategy

The main job: provide a way to "score" success of the product with KPIs.  It gives us a framework to reason about progress or diagnose root cause analysis.

A strategy answers:

1. How do we measure success/what does winning look like?
2. How does that change over time? (eg: are there milestones we can associate with metric changes?)

The strategy is where KPIs, or metrics, will be introduced and refined.

For example, on initial product launch, you will have some idea of metrics you wish to see impacted, along with some backstop metrics.

For example, in the beginning of a product, the strategy metrics may be favoring adoption and growth; and as the months pass, retention and continuing engagement metrics may be more heavily favored.

## Roadmap

The main job of the roadmap: to communicate prioritization of features to stakeholders and the team with some time basis around completion.

Roadmaps, once created, are not constant.  They are snapshots and could change anytime the PM becomes aware of new information, which may happen frequently.

It is a communication tool to their team, and to the stakeholders of the product

There are four things I like to use roadmaps to accomplish:

1. What milestone are we aiming for next? (A good transition from the strategy)

2. What features are we working on to get there?

3. Why? (What buckets do they fall into?)

4. Is there an expectation of timeframe for delivery?
