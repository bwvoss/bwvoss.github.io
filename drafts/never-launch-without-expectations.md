title: NEVER LAUNCH WITHOUT ASSUMPTIONS TO TEST
---

- when a product release occurs, what was your hypothesis about what would happen?
- did it or did it not?

As a PM, its common to see releases happen frequently, and due to that PMs often loose sight of cause-effect change from their metrics and discussions with customers.

2 things for each release: Launch criteria as well as backstop metrics

It provides a framework to reason about the cost-benefit trade-offs of product decisions.

It gets us to A-B testing to know if a full feature rollout is a good idea (eg watchtime implications to comment engagement).  So then we can safely rollout the feature.





A funnel also helps to consider change effect.
