title: INTERNAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT: DO I CREATE A PRODUCT VISION?
---

This is the first in a series where I will dive into the differences between building products for internal use at a company -- think things like developer toolsets -- compared to building products to actually sell in an open, competitive market.

The goal of a product vision is to communicate how the future will change because your product exists.  This is often a layering of user analysis, competitor analysis, technology trends, and ultimately providing the feeling that investing in this product is a good idea.


I've seen companies operate at some place on the spectrum between:

product managers are given a goal/product <--> product managers are given access to data and goals, and told to find and pitch problems the company will invest in.
