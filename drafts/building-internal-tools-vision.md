title: INTERNAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT: DO I CREATE A PRODUCT VISION?
---

> If I am starting a new product for internal use, do I need to create a product vision?
The difference in role responsibility and name is one of the more difficult problems in technical product management.  In short, this depends on the context of the organization.  I have seen the responsibilities manifest in 3 different ways:

1. The strategic layer is above you and you work with the strategic allocators.

2. You are expected to deliver on strategy and product/program delivery.

3. Both above contexts, depending on the initiative, but not evenly split.

product managers are given a goal/product <--> product managers are given access to data and goals, and told to find and pitch problems the company will invest in.
