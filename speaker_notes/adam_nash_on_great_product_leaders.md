Notes:
- There is no perfect: this is the list of things to build and in order at all times
- most will be metric movers.  They "move" the business.  They are tied to the business and the economics. "If you focus on the problem of how to move the business forward, you usually will.  But _that_ will not build a great relationship with your customers by itself."
- with customers, must deliver on a cadence.
- if you do the both well, your customers will like you, but they won't _love_ you.  There is an "irrational" relationship for the product which makes it very difficult to compete against.  At Apple, there is a value in "customer surprise".  "Delight" is delivered to your customers on a cadence as well.
- Often times, the feature will fit into just one of the buckets.
- Put prioritized lists in each of the buckets, otherwise you fall into the danger of just prioritizing metrics movers.
