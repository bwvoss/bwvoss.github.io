Hey there!  I'm Ben.  I love computers, programming, and technical product management.  After nearly a decade of software and cloud infrastructure engineering, the startup I worked for got merged into a larger corporation, and for reasons I'll leave for a longer discussion, I moved into technical product management.  I use this website as a place to keep straddling between the two areas of software engineering and product management.
